# wine_ML

This was my final project for an Intro to Machine Learning class (completed in Fall 2021). The idea behind the project was to use text mining combined with various supervised learning techniques to predict how a wine reviewer would numerically score a given wine based on their written review. There is also an unsupervised task at the end of the notebook just for fun. The only necessary source file is winemag_data.csv.
